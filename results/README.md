# Results
In the results maps are all results generated by the code in the project. The main folder consists of four maps. Named string1, string2, string3 and string4. The proteins used in these folders are taken from the case. String1 is the shortest protein string with only P and H. String 2 is the largest with P and H. String 3 and string 4 are the largest strings with P, H and C.

### Strings used in folders
string1 = HHPHHHPHPHHHPH
string2 = HHPHPHPHPHHHHPHPPPHPPPHPPPPHPPPHPPPHPHHHHPHPHPHPHH
string3 = HCPHPCPHPCHCHPHPPPHPPPHPPPPHPCPHPPPHPHHHCCHCHCHCHH
string4 = HCPHPHPHCHHHHPCCPPHPPPHPPPPCPPPHPPPHPHHHHCHPHPHPHH

In each folder are results that belong to the specified protein string. One can find folders belonging to the algorithms and some files that include results of all algorithms. In these folders are specific results generated for specific algorithms. There are folders for greedy, chunky path and forward search.

### Greedy
In all greedy folders, one can find histograms that compare the care factors, depending on the dimensions used. This can be found in a file named care_hist_2D (or 3D). Furthermore
