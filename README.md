# Protein Pow(d)er

This project uses algorithms to search for the best possible way to fold a protein string, such that the string is as stable as possible. In this case, a protein string consists of 3 sorts of amino acids, called P (Polar), H (Hydrophobic) and C (Cysteine). Two H's next to each other can score -1 point together, two C's can score -5 points, a H and a C can score -1 point and P will never score any points. As the stability is counted in negative values, a lower score implies a better stability.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
The code is fully written in [Python3.6.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-369/). In requirements.txt one can find all necessary packages needed to run the code without fail, they can be installed by using the following command in the terminal:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Structure
All python files can be found in the map code. In the map results one can find all results generated by the python code.

### Running the code
